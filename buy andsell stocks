You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n=prices.size();
    int maxmprofit=0;
    int currentprofit=0;
    int minvalue=INT_MAX;
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
    {

         minvalue=min(prices[i],minvalue);
        currentprofit=prices[i]-minvalue;

        maxmprofit=max(currentprofit,maxmprofit);

       
    }
    return maxmprofit;
    }
};
